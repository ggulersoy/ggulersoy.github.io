	abstract = {This paper presents a technical assessment of nature-related risks within the Hungarian economy and financial system. The study draws upon the OECD Supervisory Framework to (i) prioritise various naturerelated risks by conducting an impact and dependency assessment, identifying key economic sectors, and pinpointing the critical natural capital assets that are most crucial to the financial system; (ii) assess the direct and indirect economic impact of three exploratory scenarios on possible acute nature-related shocks using input-output analysis; (iii) explore the different financial risk channels through which economic risks stemming from nature-related losses may be transmitted within the Hungarian financial system; and (iv) provide supervisory recommendations based on the results.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the claim that historical persistence of political ideology is a determinant of electoral outcomes. We study the context of France, and more specifically the relationship between the anti-Dreyfusard camp in 1898 and the electoral fortunes of Front National. We demonstrate that there is no statistically significant relationship between the share of votes for anti-Dreyfusard candidates in the legislative elections of 1898 during the peak of the Dreyfus Affair, and the share of votes for FN or its presidential candidate in the legislative and presidential elections since 1986, controlling for the variables widely mentioned in the literature as having contributed to the rise of the populist far-right in the 21st century. These findings show that the historical persistence of right-wing ideology was not a determinant of FN’s electoral success, and that contemporary determinants such as unemployment or immigration explain a larger variation in the electoral support for FN more significantly.},
