	abstract = {This paper presents a technical assessment of nature-related risks within the Hungarian economy and financial system. The study draws upon the OECD Supervisory Framework to (i) prioritise various naturerelated risks by conducting an impact and dependency assessment, identifying key economic sectors, and pinpointing the critical natural capital assets that are most crucial to the financial system; (ii) assess the direct and indirect economic impact of three exploratory scenarios on possible acute nature-related shocks using input-output analysis; (iii) explore the different financial risk channels through which economic risks stemming from nature-related losses may be transmitted within the Hungarian financial system; and (iv) provide supervisory recommendations based on the results.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the claim that historical persistence of political ideology is a determinant of electoral outcomes. We study the context of France, and more specifically the relationship between the anti-Dreyfusard camp in 1898 and the electoral fortunes of Front National. We demonstrate that there is no statistically significant relationship between the share of votes for anti-Dreyfusard candidates in the legislative elections of 1898 during the peak of the Dreyfus Affair, and the share of votes for FN or its presidential candidate in the legislative and presidential elections since 1986, controlling for the variables widely mentioned in the literature as having contributed to the rise of the populist far-right in the 21st century. These findings show that the historical persistence of right-wing ideology was not a determinant of FN’s electoral success, and that contemporary determinants such as unemployment or immigration explain a larger variation in the electoral support for FN more significantly.},

Our treatment, implemented through two ﬁeld experiments among potential applicants to a ﬁve-month software-coding program targeted at low-income women in Peru and Mexico, counterbalances the strong male stereotype associated with a career in tech. Although our informational messages substantially increase application rates, including candidates at the top of the cognitive skill distribution, they introduce negative selection on cognitive skills, implying a higher cost of screening. Moreover, we observe selection on the noncognitive dimensions addressed with the treatment (e.g., stronger gender stereotypes and traditional norms). This points to the barriers that preclude more women from applying to tech positions, as well as the trade-offs for organizations of adopting such a strategy.},

	abstract = {We study the stock market performance of firms with Jewish board members during the “Dreyfus Affair” in 19th century France. In a context of widespread latent antisemitism, initial accusations made against the Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus led to short-lived abnormal negative returns for Jewish-connected firms. However, investors betting on these firms earned higher returns during the period corresponding to Dreyfus' rehabilitation, starting with the publication of the famous op-ed J'Accuse! in 1898. Our conceptual framework illustrates how diminishing antisemitic biases among investors might plausibly explain these effects. Our paper provides novel insights on how antisemitism can increase and decrease over short periods of time at the highest socio-economic levels in response to certain events, which in turn can affect firm value in financial markets.},

	abstract = {While soft skills are increasingly rewarded in labor markets (Heckman and Kautz, 2012, Deming, 2017), employers often mention a lack of soft skills among candidates as a reason for unfilled vacancies (Ple Emploi, 2018). To address this issue, the French unemployment agency, Ple Emploi, identified a set of 16 soft skills that were essential for job seekers and designed a training specifically geared to soft skill development. The training provided by Ple Emploi to job seekers is called Valoriser son Image Pro (VSI). The training is administered by partner training agencies and has a one-week module that can be supplemented by up to another week.

In this project, we are designing a randomized control trial using an encouragement design via calls to evaluate whether this soft skill training program improves the situation of its beneficiaries (e.g. unemployment duration and employment outcomes) and if so through which channels. The main aim of this project is to answer the following questions: Are soft skills malleable in adulthood? How do they impact job search behavior and job finding outcomes? In a second project, we plan to use our experimental sample to better understand how soft skills impact the take up of training.},

            Tax collection with limited enforcement capacity may be consistent with both high- and low-delinquency regimes: high delinquency reduces the effectiveness of threats, thereby reinforcing high delinquency. We explore the practical challenges of unraveling the high-delinquency equilibrium using a mechanism design insight known as divide-and-conquer. Our preferred mechanism takes the form of prioritized iterative enforcement (PIE). Taxpayers are ranked using the ratio of expected collection to capacity use. Collection threats are issued in small batches to ensure high credibility and induce high compliance. Following repayments, liberated capacity is used to issue the next round of threats. In collaboration with a district of Lima, we experimentally assess PIE in a sample of 13,432 property taxpayers. The data validate and refine our theoretical framework. A semi-structural model suggests that keeping collection actions fixed, PIE would increase tax revenue by roughly 10\%.},

	abstract = {This paper reevaluates the longstanding debate on capital-labor substitution by examining the role of external inputs: commodities, intermediate goods and services, imports, offshoring. With more than two factors of production, there is more than one relative price. This paper shows that consequently—and in contrast to many workhorse models—external inputs can lead the capital-labor ratio to respond differently to changes in labor and to changes in capital prices. Both indirect inference (based on a meta analysis of existing studies) and direct estimates (using U.S. data for 1963-2016) indicate that external inputs disproportionately displace labor. These findings imply (1) that the capital-labor ratio responds 40-80\% more strongly to the price of labor than to the price of capital, (2) that capital and labor are not separable from external inputs in modeling production, and (3) that historical disagreements regarding substitution can be recast as an omitted variable bias involving external inputs.},
