abstract: This paper presents a technical assessment of nature-related risks within
  the Hungarian economy and financial system. The study draws upon the OECD Supervisory
  Framework to (i) prioritise various naturerelated risks by conducting an impact
  and dependency assessment, identifying key economic sectors, and pinpointing the
  critical natural capital assets that are most crucial to the financial system; (ii)
  assess the direct and indirect economic impact of three exploratory scenarios on
  possible acute nature-related shocks using input-output analysis; (iii) explore
  the different financial risk channels through which economic risks stemming from
  nature-related losses may be transmitted within the Hungarian financial system;
  and (iv) provide supervisory recommendations based on the results.
