abstract: This study investigates the claim that historical persistence of political
  ideology is a determinant of electoral outcomes. We study the context of France,
  and more specifically the relationship between the anti-Dreyfusard camp in 1898
  and the electoral fortunes of Front National. We demonstrate that there is no statistically
  significant relationship between the share of votes for anti-Dreyfusard candidates
  in the legislative elections of 1898 during the peak of the Dreyfus Affair, and
  the share of votes for FN or its presidential candidate in the legislative and presidential
  elections since 1986, controlling for the variables widely mentioned in the literature
  as having contributed to the rise of the populist far-right in the 21st century.
  These findings show that the historical persistence of right-wing ideology was not
  a determinant of FN’s electoral success, and that contemporary determinants such
  as unemployment or immigration explain a larger variation in the electoral support
  for FN more significantly.
