abstract: We study the stock market performance of firms with Jewish board members
  during the “Dreyfus Affair” in 19th century France. In a context of widespread latent
  antisemitism, initial accusations made against the Jewish officer Alfred Dreyfus
  led to short-lived abnormal negative returns for Jewish-connected firms. However,
  investors betting on these firms earned higher returns during the period corresponding
  to Dreyfus' rehabilitation, starting with the publication of the famous op-ed J'Accuse!
  in 1898. Our conceptual framework illustrates how diminishing antisemitic biases
  among investors might plausibly explain these effects. Our paper provides novel
  insights on how antisemitism can increase and decrease over short periods of time
  at the highest socio-economic levels in response to certain events, which in turn
  can affect firm value in financial markets.
