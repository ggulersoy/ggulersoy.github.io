abstract: Gendered-grammar languages like Spanish are spoken by 39% of the world’s
  population. In a field experiment in partnership with a Spanish-speaking online
  platform for technology positions, ads randomly selected to use gender-neutral language
  receive a larger share of female applicants for non-remote positions in fields where
  female participation is not too low, and similar numbers otherwise. In a separate
  survey experiment, gender-neutral language in ads increases interest and beliefs
  about the suitability for the position and the advertiser’s culture of inclusion,
  with effects that are similar in magnitude to stating the job is remote and larger
  than explicit diversity statements.
