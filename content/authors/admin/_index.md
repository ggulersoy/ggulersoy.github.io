#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at King’s Business School. I focus on the role of large firms in the transmission of shocks and spillovers within the Turkish production network. 

My research employs a novel firm-level input-output matrix to analyze various types of shocks —supply chain, financial, regulatory, technological, and informational— to provide valuable insights for economic policy.

Before joining King’s, I worked as a policy analyst at the OECD and as a research associate at INSEAD. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Political Sciences with a regional focus on the Middle East and the Mediterranean, and a master’s degree in Economics and Public Policy, both from Sciences Po Paris.

My primary research interests include public, urban, and input-output economics, with a particular focus on trade, where I use microdata to support evidence-based policymaking.
