abstract: 'Tax collection with limited enforcement capacity may be consistent
  with both high- and low-delinquency regimes: high delinquency reduces the effectiveness
  of threats, thereby reinforcing high delinquency. We explore the practical challenges
  of unraveling the high-delinquency equilibrium using a mechanism design insight
  known as divide-and-conquer. Our preferred mechanism takes the form of prioritized
  iterative enforcement (PIE). Taxpayers are ranked using the ratio of expected collection
  to capacity use. Collection threats are issued in small batches to ensure high credibility
  and induce high compliance. Following repayments, liberated capacity is used to
  issue the next round of threats. In collaboration with a district of Lima, we experimentally
  assess PIE in a sample of 13,432 property taxpayers. The data validate and refine
  our theoretical framework. A semi-structural model suggests that keeping collection
  actions fixed, PIE would increase tax revenue by roughly 10%.'
