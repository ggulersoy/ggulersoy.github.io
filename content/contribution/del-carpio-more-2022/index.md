abstract: We study the impact of using informational messaging aimed at encouraging
  women to seek a career in technology and the resulting trade-offs for organizations
  pursuing recruitment strategies of this kind. Our treatment, implemented through
  two ﬁeld experiments among potential applicants to a ﬁve-month software-coding program
  targeted at low-income women in Peru and Mexico, counterbalances the strong male
  stereotype associated with a career in tech. Although our informational messages
  substantially increase application rates, including candidates at the top of the
  cognitive skill distribution, they introduce negative selection on cognitive skills,
  implying a higher cost of screening. Moreover, we observe selection on the noncognitive
  dimensions addressed with the treatment (e.g., stronger gender stereotypes and traditional
  norms). This points to the barriers that preclude more women from applying to tech
  positions, as well as the trade-offs for organizations of adopting such a strategy.
